# Pocket ID

I have been follwing this project for awhile, but it finally made its way into my homelab. [Pocket ID](https://github.com/stonith404/pocket-id) is a Simple OIDC Provider that uses Passkeys for User Authentication. 

I have recently opened up a PR to add [LDAP Sync](https://github.com/stonith404/pocket-id/pull/106) and im hoping this will make it into version 0.25.0!

I also have Refactored there docs to use docusaurus. 

Keep following as i may be helping out more with this project :D
